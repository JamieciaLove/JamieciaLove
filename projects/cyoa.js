// Choose your fate: Red Pill or Purple Pill?
// Purple pill - Welp you will continue living in blissful ignorance on your ride to the gallows. Enjoy.
// Red Pill - Are you sure you made the right choice? If not, too late. I will ask you a series of 5 questions. What is the prize after making it to the end?
